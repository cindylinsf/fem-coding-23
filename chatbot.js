      It can be challenging to come up with things to say in new situations.
      Practice and experience can help improve your conversation skills!
      
      Can we try a few things here:
      1. Have some conversation topics in your back pocket. For example, the weather, latest shows, etc.
      2. Have relevant conversation topics that relate to the event. For example, if you are at a JavaScript conference, you can talk about what others think about the new announcements.
      3. Ask people questions and listen.
      4. If all else fails, a smile and nod work pretty well. üòä

      To do this, start by thinking a topic that you are comfortable with. 
      Then, come up with three things you can chat to people about.
      Regardless your reason for feeling uncomfortable to speak in a new setting,
      we can start by preparing ourselves with conversation topics that can help to break the ice.

      Language barriers can make it difficult to communicate effectively,
      because we are afraid to say the wrong things.
      But that's totally okay! Even native speakers can make very common mistakes.
      The key is to practice. 
      With practice, you can overcome this challenge and become more confident with speaking a foreign language.

      Here are a few tips from personal experience: 
      1) I learned English by watching the TV show Friends with subtitltes on.
      This way, I learned conversational English while learning new vocabulary, tone and how people communicate, make jokes, etc.
      2) I started by reading children's books, one book a day.
      3) I used meetup.com to find language meetups where I can meet new friends and practice language.
      4) Find a lanugage tutor and start practicing speaking, especially for the day-to-day conversations.
      The more you use the language everyday, the easier it will be.

      Remember, everyone feels a little nervous at times. Take small steps and gradually build your confidence.
      
      Here are a few strategies for you:
      Start small, actively listen for clues on what they are interested in. 
      Ask open-ended questions to get more information.
      Use your common grounds and start conversations from there.
